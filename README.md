Working scripts for using structure functions and coarse-graining methods to estimate turbulent energy and enstrophy fluxes for ocean sea surface data. 

Using simulated ocean velocities, emulated SWOT SSH swaths, and the beta prevalidated SWOT SSH swaths. Filenames and paths correspond to my local machine and should be replaced for another user. 

All scripts are set up for parallel processing and depend on datasets not included in this repository. For large files and large number of files, the parallel setup becomes very memory-intensive so **these scripts are not recommended as a plug-and-play method.**
